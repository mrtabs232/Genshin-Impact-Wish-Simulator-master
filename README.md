I'm not expert, I can't write clean code, but I try to create this Genshin Impact Wish Simulator. I can claim this is the most Realistic one for web version. However, I still need your feedbacks to improve the wishing experience. If you like this Simulator, please give a star to this repository

## Pity System

I don't know how HoyoVerse's algorithm is, so I tried to create mine as realistic as possible with the following points based on in-game wish details. I also use [GI Gacha Dataset](https://github.com/OneBST/GI_gacha_dataset) as reference for wish probability.

> if you feel luckier when you roll in this simulator, I can tell you it's just a feeling, In the simulator you can do a thousand or more rolls without limit, In real games your wishes are limited by the game currencies, therefore more chance to get multiple \*5 item in this wish simulator

1. Probability for \*4 item

   - 4* Item guaranteed at 10 roll and promoted *4 item guaranteed at 20 roll.
   - Probability to get \*4 item is 5.1%, at pity 9 the rate increased to 56.1% and at pity 10 or more, the rate is 100% (guaranteed)

   | **Pity** |  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   |  6   |  7   |  8   |   9   |  10  |  11  |
   | -------: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :---: | :--: | :--: |
   | **Rate** | 5.1% | 5.1% | 5.1% | 5.1% | 5.1% | 5.1% | 5.1% | 5.1% | 56.1% | 100% | 100% |

2. Character Event and Standard Wish Probability

   - *5 Item guaranteed at 90 roll and promoted *5 item guaranteed at 180 roll.
   - Probability to get \*5 item is 0.6%, at pity 74 the rate starts to increase by 6% and then guaranteed at pity 90.

   | **Pity** | 1-73 |  74  |  75   |  76   |  77   |  78   |  79   |  80   |  81   |  82   |  83   |  84   |  85   |  86   |  87   |  88   |  89   |  90  |
   | -------: | :--: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--: |
   | **Rate** | 0.6% | 6.6% | 12.6% | 18.6% | 24.6% | 30.6% | 36.6% | 42.6% | 48.6% | 54.6% | 60.6% | 66.6% | 72.6% | 78.6% | 84.6% | 90.6% | 96.6% | 100% |

3. Weapons Wish Probability

   - *5 Item guaranteed at 80 roll and promoted *5 item guaranteed at 160 roll.
   - Probability to get \*5 item is 0.7%, at pity 63 the rate starts to increase by 7%, after pity 73 the rate increased by 3.5% and then guaranteed at pity 80.

   | **Pity** | 1-62 |  63  |  64   |  65   |  66   |  67   |  68   |  69   |  70   |  71   |  72   |  73   |  74   |  75   |  76   |  77   |  78   |  79   |  80  |
   | -------: | :--: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--: |
   | **Rate** | 0.7% | 7.7% | 14.7% | 21.7% | 28.7% | 35.7% | 42.7% | 49.7% | 56.7% | 63.7% | 70.7% | 77.7% | 81.2% | 84.7% | 88.2% | 91.7% | 95.2% | 98.7% | 100% |

4. When you guaranteed for *5 and *4 item at the same time, your next pull priority is *5 star item and *4 item will appear next at pity 11. For example: On Character Event Banner, you doesn't get *5 star item until pity 89 and your *4 pity is 9, So your next pull will looks like screenshot below.
